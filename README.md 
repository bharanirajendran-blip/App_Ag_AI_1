# Sentinel - AI Security Incident Analyzer

**Week 1 Project - GRAD 5900: Applied Generative AI**

## Overview
Sentinel uses ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern to analyze security incidents and provide actionable recommendations.

## Features
- ✅ ReAct reasoning pattern implementation
- ✅ Multiple security incident scenarios
- ✅ Simulated investigation workflow
- ✅ Actionable security recommendations

## Setup

1. Clone repository
2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create `.env` file with your Anthropic API key:
```bash
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```
5. Run:
```bash
   python3 sentinel_v1.py
```

## Test Cases
- **SSH Brute Force**: Tor exit node attacking production server
- **Disk Full**: Critical storage space on database server
- **Cryptominer**: Suspicious process consuming resources

## Next Steps (Week 2+)
- Add Chain-of-Thought enhancements
- Implement LangGraph state machine
- Add vector database for incident memory
- Build MCP servers for real system integration
