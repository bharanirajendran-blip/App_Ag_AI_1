# ReAct Prompt Example

You are a research assistant helping me plan a trip to Japan.

Use this ReAct format:

**Thought:** [Analyze what information you need]  
**Action:** [Specify what action to take: search, calculate, or conclude]  
**Observation:** [Record what you found]

Repeat until you have enough information, then provide your final answer.

**Question:** What's the best time to visit Tokyo for cherry blossoms, 
and what's the approximate flight cost from New York in that period?

---

## Why this works:
- **Clear structure**: Forces the model to show its reasoning steps
- **Actionable**: Can be connected to real tools (web search, flight APIs)
- **Testable**: You can verify if the model follows the format correctly
- **Practical**: Solves a real problem while demonstrating the ReAct pattern

**Course Context:** This is the type of prompt you'll build on in Week 2, 
then enhance with tool-calling in Week 3, and scale into full agentic 
workflows by Week 8.
